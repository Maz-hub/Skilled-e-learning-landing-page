# Frontend Mentor - Skilled e-learning landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Skilled e-learning landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://maz-hub.github.io/Skilled-e-learning-landing-page/](https://maz-hub.github.io/Skilled-e-learning-landing-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM Naming

### What I learned

This project was a great practice in effectively using SCSS to streamline styling, especially with the use of `@mixin` for colors and buttons. I also honed my skills in applying the BEM naming convention for CSS classes, which improves the readability and maintainability of the stylesheet.

### Continued development

I'm looking to deepen my understanding of SCSS, exploring more of its advanced features. I also plan to refine my responsive design skills, ensuring seamless transitions across different device sizes.
